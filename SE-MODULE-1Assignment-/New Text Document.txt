Q.1.What is software? What is software engineering?
Ans.Software is a collection of instructions that tell a computer what to do, while software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing,
and maintaining software. 

Q.2.Explain types of software.
Ans.The main types of software are system software, application software, and programming software.
 
1.System software 
Manages how the user interacts with the computer's hardware
Runs in the background to maintain the computer's basic functions
Provides a platform for applications to run on
Includes programs that communicate with the computer's processor

2.Application software
Performs specific tasks for the user, such as word processing, browsing the internet, or playing games 
Includes programs that are designed for specific users, such as AutoCAD for designers or Adobe Premiere for video editors 

3.Programming software
Provides the tools that software developers need to create new software 
Includes programs such as interpreters, text editors, and compilers 

Other types of software
Middleware, which sits between system software and applications 
Driver software, which operates computer devices and peripherals 
Assemblers, which convert basic computer instructions into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use 
Most people interact with computers using application software.

Q.3.What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC 
Ans.SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It's a structured process for creating software that involves planning, analysis, design, development, testing, 
and deployment. The goal of SDLC is to create high-quality software that's cost-effective and meets client needs. 

Phases of SDLC 
Planning: Set goals and define requirements for the project
Analysis: Understand the customer's needs and requirements
Design: Create a design based on the requirements
Development: Build the software based on the design
Testing: Test the software to ensure it meets requirements
Deployment: Make the software available for use
Maintenance: Continuously improve the software
SDLC models
There are many different SDLC models, including the Waterfall model, V-Shaped model, Prototype model, Spiral model, Iterative Incremental model, Big Bang model, and Agile model. Each model has its own advantages and disadvantages. 
SDLC benefits
SDLC aims to reduce risks and errors by incorporating client feedback and iterative testing. It also improves the development timeline and reduces redundancy. 

Q.4.What is DFD? Create a DFD diagram on Flipkart
Ans.Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) provide a graphical representation of the data flow of a system that can be understood by both technical and non-technical users.
The models enable software engineers, customers, and users to work together effectively during the analysis and specification of requirements.

Q.5.What is Flow chart? Create a flowchart to make addition of two numbers
Ans.A flowchart is a visual representation of a process, system, or algorithm. It uses standardized shapes and arrows to map out the steps involved, 
making it easy to understand the flow of information and decision-making. Imagine it as a roadmap for your logic, laid out in a way that anyone can follow.

Q.6.What is Use case Diagram? Create a use-case on bill payment on paytm.
Ans.Use Case Diagram for Payment. A use case diagram example developed for a Payment system. Use this design as a use case diagram example for teaching.
The design can also be customized as a use case diagram template, with Visual Paradigm's use case diagram tool.
